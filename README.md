## About the Project
Hi! I'm Aafia Ibrahim, an aspiring data analyst, and this is my very first SQL project and GitHub repository. I wanted to explore real-world data and sharpen my SQL skills, so I picked something we all love—Netflix! Using a dataset of Netflix movies and TV shows, I’ve tried to answer interesting questions using SQL queries and draw meaningful insights from the data.

## What I Worked On
-Compared Movies vs TV Shows on the platform
-Explored common ratings and genres
-Looked into trends by year, country, and duration
-Filtered content by directors, keywords, and actors
-Identified top performers and categories based on specific logic

## Dataset

The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:

- **Dataset Link:** [Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download)

## Schema

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS netflix;
CREATE TABLE netflix
(
    show_id      VARCHAR(5),
    type         VARCHAR(10),
    title        VARCHAR(250),
    director     VARCHAR(550),
    casts        VARCHAR(1050),
    country      VARCHAR(550),
    date_added   VARCHAR(55),
    release_year INT,
    rating       VARCHAR(15),
    duration     VARCHAR(15),
    listed_in    VARCHAR(250),
    description  VARCHAR(550)
);
```

## Business Problems and Solutions

### 1. Count the Number of Movies vs TV Shows

```sql
SELECT 
    type,
    COUNT(*)
FROM netflix
GROUP BY 1;
```

### 2. Find the Most Common Rating for Movies and TV Shows

```sql
WITH RatingCounts AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        COUNT(*) AS rating_count
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY type, rating
),
RankedRatings AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        rating_count,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY rating_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM RatingCounts
)
SELECT 
    type,
    rating AS most_frequent_rating
FROM RankedRatings
WHERE rank = 1;
```

### 3. List All Movies Released in a Specific Year (e.g., 2020)

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM netflix
WHERE release_year = 2020;
```

### 4. Find the Top 5 Countries with the Most Content on Netflix

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM
(
    SELECT 
        UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country, ',')) AS country,
        COUNT(*) AS total_content
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY 1
) AS t1
WHERE country IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY total_content DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 5. Identify the Longest Movie

```sql
SELECT 
    *
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1)::INT DESC;
```

### 6. Find Content Added in the Last 5 Years

```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix
WHERE TO_DATE(date_added, 'Month DD, YYYY') >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5 years';
```

### 7. Find All Movies/TV Shows by Director 'Rajiv Chilaka'

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT 
        *,
        UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(director, ',')) AS director_name
    FROM netflix
) AS t
WHERE director_name = 'Rajiv Chilaka';
```

### 8. List All TV Shows with More Than 5 Seasons

```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'TV Show'
  AND SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1)::INT > 5;
```

### 9. Count the Number of Content Items in Each Genre

```sql
SELECT 
    UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(listed_in, ',')) AS genre,
    COUNT(*) AS total_content
FROM netflix
GROUP BY 1;
```

### 10.Find each year and the average numbers of content release in India on netflix. 
return top 5 year with highest avg content release!

```sql
SELECT 
    country,
    release_year,
    COUNT(show_id) AS total_release,
    ROUND(
        COUNT(show_id)::numeric /
        (SELECT COUNT(show_id) FROM netflix WHERE country = 'India')::numeric * 100, 2
    ) AS avg_release
FROM netflix
WHERE country = 'India'
GROUP BY country, release_year
ORDER BY avg_release DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 11. List All Movies that are Documentaries

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM netflix
WHERE listed_in LIKE '%Documentaries';
```

### 12. Find All Content Without a Director

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM netflix
WHERE director IS NULL;
```

### 13. Find How Many Movies Actor 'Salman Khan' Appeared in the Last 10 Years

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM netflix
WHERE casts LIKE '%Salman Khan%'
  AND release_year > EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) - 10;
```

### 14. Find the Top 10 Actors Who Have Appeared in the Highest Number of Movies Produced in India

```sql
SELECT 
    UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(casts, ',')) AS actor,
    COUNT(*)
FROM netflix
WHERE country = 'India'
GROUP BY actor
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 15. Categorize Content Based on the Presence of 'Kill' and 'Violence' Keywords

```sql
SELECT 
    category,
    COUNT(*) AS content_count
FROM (
    SELECT 
        CASE 
            WHEN description ILIKE '%kill%' OR description ILIKE '%violence%' THEN 'Bad'
            ELSE 'Good'
        END AS category
    FROM netflix
) AS categorized_content
GROUP BY category;
```

##  Key Takeaways
-More movies than shows are available on Netflix.
-Most popular ratings are TV-MA and TV-14.
-The US and India lead in content production.
-Documentaries and dramas dominate genre-wise.
-Useful insights can be pulled by filtering descriptions and cast data.
